  - name: About DevHQ
    description: DevHQ is a group that hosts virtual happy hours and group projects. Events are a mix of group games, open discussion, and project updates, and are free to attend. There's no pressure to work on the team projects, so feel free to come just for the happy hours.
  - name: OSS Projects
    description: 'Group projects are hosted in our community GitHub organization. During events, we will breakout into groups for project-based discussions. The purpose of
    including projects in the group is to intentionally build teams and networks outside
    of the office. Projects give tech newcomers a collaborative experience to round out
    their resume. Seasoned professionals may look at projects as a chance to sharpen
    skills, mentor others, and learn to lead a team. Every active project must have an
    active project lead. Leads are there to scope out digestible task, aggregate
    documentation, and unblock contributors. Discord channels will be setup for project
    groups to communicate asynchronously.'
  - name: Community Guidelines
    description: '<p><u>Be respectful</u>: Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathic fashion. We do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not an enjoyable or inclusive one.</p><p><u>Take responsibility</u>: for words and actions. We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully, and work to right the wrong.</p><p><u>Be considerate</u>: Events, online chat, and code repositories will be experienced by other people. Decisions we make will affect members, users, and more, so we should consider others when making decisions.</p>'
  - name: Background
    description: 'I founded DevHQ: Seattle in December 2020 because there seemed to be a gap in local meetups for virtual happy hours + hackathons. Existing meetups focused either newcomers to the field or veterans discussing niche topics. I think hosting fun, open-ended events & projects will make room for developers with different backgrounds to mingle and learn from each other. - Kevin Caravaggio'
