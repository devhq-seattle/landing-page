  - name: About DevHQ

    description: '<p><u>Be respectful</u>: Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathic fashion. We do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not an enjoyable or inclusive one.</p><p><u>Take responsibility</u>: for words and actions. We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully, and work to right the wrong.</p><p><u>Be considerate</u>: Events, online chat, and code repositories will be experienced by other people. Decisions we make will affect members, users, and more, so we should consider others when making decisions.</p>'
  - name: Background
    description: 'I founded DevHQ: Seattle in December 2020 because there seemed to be a gap in local meetups for virtual happy hours + hackathons. Existing meetups focused either newcomers to the field or veterans discussing niche topics. I think hosting fun, open-ended events & projects will make room for developers with different backgrounds to mingle and learn from each other. - Kevin Caravaggio'
